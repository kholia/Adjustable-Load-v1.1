### Variable Electronic Load

This variable electronic load helps with testing power supplies, and batteries.

Motivation: RIGOL DC Electronic Load-DL3021 costs ~50k - this project costs
nothing in comparison, and does the job in typical amateur radio contexts just
fine.

Rating: 20A @ 30V depending upon the heatsink.

Testing notes (Dhiru): I have tested my build up to 5A @ around 20v.
